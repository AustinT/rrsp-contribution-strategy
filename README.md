# rrsp-contribution-strategy
A short investigation into different strategies one might use to contribute to a registered retirement savings account (RRSP)

Basically, this repo serves to answer the question "if I will end up going into a higher tax bracket in the next few years, should I defer putting money into my RRSP in order to save money later"? Basically it seems that the answer is no. This stategy will likely have a negative effect on you, and if the effect is positive it might only be a thousand dollars over 10 years. Even that is under some strong assumptions of a very aggressive salary increase.

**Note**: I am not an accountant, and this repo has made some simplifying assumptions, and doesn't include things like a TFSA. The code might not be the greatest. If you come across this repo and want to use it, feel free to ping me and I can do a better job cleaning/documenting the code.
